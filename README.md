## Architecture/design decisons:

- I have kept the Application model small as of now as its a project to test my coding ability. Eg: Emitted fields like Phone_number, Degree etc deliberately, for the reasons stated before.

- UUID is better for performing queries faster.

- For patch request, dont keep ending slash
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2712682/how-to-select-a-record-and-update-it-with-a-single-queryset-in-django

- Eg: Backend developer and frontend developer jobs exist.
      So if a user applied for backend role, they can't apply for frontend with same email id due to current design having email id as unique field.

  Sol: Use uuid or shorter ID instead, i used email before to get an application uniquely as its easier by now how to go with id only.

- Eg: UUID vs Normal ID : https://stackoverflow.com/a/58737923/13946919
 
- How to upload file:
1) Install pillow.
2) Make necessary changes in settings file for configuration of files.
3) Define the model.
4) Define the serializer.
5) Define the view.
EG: Resume uploaded: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/resumes/3a5fa5e4-21c9-21ce-b0eb-d5d335275f2d.pdf
